Creating a README file is a good practice to provide documentation and usage instructions for your code. Here's a template for a README file for your Arduino-based smart car parking system:

# Smart Car Parking System - Arduino Code

This repository contains the Arduino code for a smart car parking system using ultrasonic sensors. This system helps automate the process of finding and parking in an available parking space.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
- Motor driver (if using motors)
- DC motors (if using a car)
- Power source for the motors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Connect the hardware components as per the provided schematic.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `smart_car_parking.ino` sketch.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the system.
2. The car will move forward until an obstacle is detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
3. The car will stop, and the servo motor will rotate to check for an available parking space.
4. If a parking space is found, the car will park.
5. If no parking space is found, the car will move back and attempt to find a space again.

## Configuration

You may need to modify the following variables in the code to match your hardware setup:

- `trigPin` and `echoPin` to the pins connected to the ultrasonic sensor.
- `motorPin1` and `motorPin2` to the pins controlling the car's motors.
- Servo angle in `servo.write()` to adjust the angle for checking parking spaces.
